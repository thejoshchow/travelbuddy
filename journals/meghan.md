Week 1 Project Travel Buddy (week 13):

After coming up with the group idea and name, we:
- created a wire frame
- wrote down our API endpoints
- completed and submitted the MVP
- worked through our layout of the project, decided the functionality we want from it and what stretch goals we could potentially accomplish.

Week 2 Project Travel Buddy (week 14):
- We presented our wireframe and received feedback to correct and add on to our API endpoints
- API endpoints finished and flushed out
- We created our table schemas which helped us implement our SQL tables. We created 8 tables.
- Our first API endpoint was completed for Create(POST) user.
- Create a trip end point was completed by mob programming as well.


Week 3 Project Travel buddy (week 15):
- This week we tackled the rest of our api endpoints.
- I worked on the get one trip, get all trips, delete a trip and update a trip.
- I also worked on the delete vote. There were issues debugging and more code needed to be added which Josh helped me with and Darnell helped to debug.
- We mob programmed the back end authentication led by Josh.
- Friday we started the front end. We did look at color schemes and logos which are still tbd.
- We have assigned ourselves to some front end work. I will start the bones for the login page.
- Darnell is adding the redux toolkit and some other tools we will need for the frontend as we will build our our frontend auth early next week.
