Week 1 Project Travel Buddy (week 13):

After coming up with the group idea and name, we:
- created a wire frame
- wrote down our API endpoints
- completed and submitted the MVP
- worked through our layout of the project, decided the functionality we want from it and what stretch goals we could potentially accomplish.

Week 2 Project Travel Buddy (week 14):
- We presented our wireframe and received feedback to correct and add on to our API endpoints
- API endpoints finished and flushed out
- We created our table schemas which helped us implement our SQL tables. We created 8 tables.
- Our first API endpoint was completed for Create(POST) user.
- Create a trip end point is currently in progress.
