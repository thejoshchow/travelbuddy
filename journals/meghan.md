Week 1 Project Travel Buddy (week 13):

After coming up with the group idea and name, we:
- created a wire frame
- wrote down our API endpoints
- completed and submitted the MVP
- worked through our layout of the project, decided the functionality we want from it and what stretch goals we could potentially accomplish.
