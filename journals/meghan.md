Week 1 Project Travel Buddy (week 13):

After coming up with the group idea and name, we:
- created a wire frame
- wrote down our API endpoints
- completed and submitted the MVP
- worked through our layout of the project, decided the functionality we want from it and what stretch goals we could potentially accomplish.

Week 2 Project Travel Buddy (week 14):
- We presented our wireframe and received feedback to correct and add on to our API endpoints
- API endpoints finished and flushed out
- We created our table schemas which helped us implement our SQL tables. We created 8 tables.
- Our first API endpoint was completed for Create(POST) user.
- Create a trip end point was completed by mob programming as well.


Week 3 Project Travel Buddy (week 15):
- This week we tackled the rest of our api endpoints.
- I worked on the get one trip, get all trips, delete a trip and update a trip.
- I also worked on the delete vote. There were issues debugging and more code needed to be added which Josh helped me with and Darnell helped to debug.
- We mob programmed the back end authentication led by Josh.
- Friday we started the front end. We did look at color schemes and logos which are still tbd.
- We have assigned ourselves to some front end work. I will start the bones for the login page.
- Darnell is adding the redux toolkit and some other tools we will need for the frontend as we will build our our frontend auth early next week.


Week 4 Travel Buddy (week 16):
- This week we started frontend components and frontend pages.
- We hashed out the deisn UI features and how we wanted the bulk of our pages to look.
- I created the login page.
- Played with bootstrap and sass.
- We each need to do a unit test. I offered to lead our group in that and show them the components for creating a Get and a Post unit test. I created those for getting all trips by a user id and for creating a trip and presented to the group earlier this week.
- I worked on desiging the login page and navbar today. I simplified the navbar we had and added a logo and I laid out and designed the login page per our design we chose earlier this week.
- Aaron and I worked on design for the trips overview page. He already had the flexbox features implemented for each category so we came up with design aspects for each card. He coded while we bounced ideas off each other and I sent over photos for the category placeholders.
